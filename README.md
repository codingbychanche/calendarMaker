# calendarMaker
Extracts data for a calendar entry from textfiles.

The company I work for provides my job schedule in plain text. Events are seperated by linefeeds
and are descriped in a fixed format which my tool parses. Date, start- and end time and the events description
are returned and can be added to any calendar. I will include *.csv export and *.ics file export.
